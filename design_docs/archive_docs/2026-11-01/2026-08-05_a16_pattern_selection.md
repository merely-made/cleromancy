# Cleromancy A16: saved pattern selection

> **Archived 2026-11-01 (landed).** Landed in `1f6589d` (2026-08-05). The A0-A25 protocol ladder ended with the headed local consultation (`15d973e`). No open points to extract.

**Date:** 2026-08-05
**Scope:** let an authorized Graphshell host save an A15 pattern occasion by
selecting existing astrology facts and an existing reading session.

## Contract

`cleromancy.create-concurrence` carries
`cleromancy.intent.create-concurrence/v1` with an astrology-facts digest and a
reading-session ID. The action is advertised on both matching saved cards, not
on a context card. Its target must be one of the exact submitted members.

Each advertised action carries a Graphshell `ActionFormV1` with two required,
endpoint-authored choice fields: `astrology_facts_digest` and
`reading_session_id`. Cleromancy derives those choices only from saved facts
that replay against their chart and saved sessions that replay against their
reading dependencies. The values are the exact digest or session ID the
endpoint will accept; labels and descriptions are presentation help only. The
action is absent until both bounded sets contain at least one value.

Before asking Servitor for the dedicated write scope, Cleromancy resolves the
facts from their canonical address, verifies them against their stored chart,
and replays the selected reading session. A bad selection is rejected without
a graph mutation or revision notice. A successful call records the ordinary
A15 collection-membership graph truth and emits the normal resnapshot notice.

## Ownership boundary

Mere owns the headed chooser that presents compatible cards and constructs the
typed payload. Cleromancy owns the endpoint-authored bounded choices, member
identity, replay validation, authorization dispatch, and the saved occasion.
The portable cards are a selection index, not an interpretation interface.

## Acceptance

1. Saved astrology-facts and reading-session cards advertise the action only
   when both replayed choice sets exist.
2. Both form fields contain only exact saved values that passed endpoint
   replay, and they compose the declared payload schema without host defaults.
3. The selected target must match either member named by the payload.
4. An authorized action saves one replayable concurrence and emits a revision
   notice.
5. A mismatched target or absent member is rejected before graph mutation.
6. The projected result still states the non-causal concurrence claim.

## Stop rule

Do not build a raw JSON form, infer a correspondence, alter Tarot weights, or
treat the action as a headed chooser. A Mere surface may add that chooser by
selecting compatible cards and sending this payload. Personal sync remains
unchanged until astrology facts have explicit opt-in selection.
